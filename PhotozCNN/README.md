# Photometric Redshift Inference on HSC data with a CNN

Notebooks in this series:

- [Part I: Data Preparation](photoz_inference_data_preparation.ipynb): Learn how to retrieve necessary data from the HSC archive (very technical)
- [Part II: Intro to TensorFlow Datasets](photoz_inference_tfdatasets.ipynb): Learn how to make your data easily usable and sharable for Deep Learning
- [Part III: Training a CNN with Keras](photoz_inference_training_exercise.ipynb): Learn how to train a CNN to predict photoz (solution [here](photoz_inference_training_solution.ipynb))

Each notebook can be followed on its own.
